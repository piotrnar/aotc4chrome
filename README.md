===========
assets-otc for chrome

A helper extension for chrome that automates gpg operations while using assets-otc.com
Having it installed in your browser you do not need to use a command line anymore.

Still for the extension to work you need to have GnuPG envirionment properly installed
and armed with your private key.

The extension uses pre-compiled binary plugins, which I took from WebPG chrome extension.
They are in ./plugins/ folder - built for Mac, Linux and Windows.
Please feel welcome to make sure that they are identical with these:
